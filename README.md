# British-Airways-Reviews-Analysis-using-Tableau

In this project, I have analysed a dataset containing reviews of British Airways, using a Tableau dashboard. 
I have frist joined Countries and ba_reviews dataset on Countries column, then created a line graph, Pie Chart, histogram and a map. 
There are 6  filters available- Aircarft name, Continent, Traveller Type, Seat Type, and type of metric on whose rating we want to filter.
All 4 visualizations are filtered using the above filters.
You can check out my dahboard on Tableau public- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aparna.verma/viz/BritishAirwaysReviewsAnalysis_17148257444960/FinalDashboard?publish=yes
